## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Server not loading**
**Solution:** Wait 10-15 seconds for full startup
```bash
# If stuck, restart in terminal:
python mri_inference_system.py
```

### **Issue: Images not crystal-clear**
**Solution:** Server has all enhancements active - if you're seeing older images, hard refresh browser:
```
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

### **Issue: Can't upload image**
**Solution:** 
- Image must be PNG or JPG format
- Image must be at least 200x200 pixels
- File size should be under 5MB

## 💡 TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

1. **Use High-Quality Medical Scans**
   - Best results with professional MRI/CT scans
   - PNG format preferred over JPG

2. **Check Tab Progression**
   - Start with Tab 2 (6-Panel) to see main analysis
   - Use Tab 1 (YOLO) to see tissue detection
   - Reference Tab 4 (Graphs) for training history

3. **Save Important Results**
   - Right-click images to save high-resolution versions
   - Screenshots available for reports

4. **Multiple Scans**
   - You can upload multiple scans sequentially
   - Each produces independent analysis
   - No interference between uploads
